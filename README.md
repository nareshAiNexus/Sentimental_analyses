# Sentimental_analysis
This project focuses on Sentiment Analysis, which involves classifying the emotions expressed in a text, such as positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can analyze text data and accurately predict the sentiment behind it.

Features:
Preprocessing of raw text data (tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization)
Sentiment classification using popular ML algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, LSTM)
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Visualization of sentiment trends over time using data visualization tools (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Technologies:
Python, NumPy, Pandas
TensorFlow/Keras (for model building)
NLTK (for text preprocessing)
